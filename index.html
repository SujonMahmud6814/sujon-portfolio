                    You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping
                    trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why
                    I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop
                    until I become the Web Development Hero.

                <p>
                    I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any
                    simple website. I can even teach my grandma how to make
                    simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn
                    advanced topics.

                    I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know
                    everything needed to make a website function, efficient. I
                    didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular
                    Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even know the
                    deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web
                    solution.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove
                    web developer. I made their website and showed it to them.
                    They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working
                    at Programming Hero.
